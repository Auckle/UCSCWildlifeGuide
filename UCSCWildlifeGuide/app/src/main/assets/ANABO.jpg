<p><strong>Habitat Associations and Natural History</strong></p>
<p>This toad inhabits desert streams and springs, grasslands, woodlands, montane forests, and mountain meadows. It can be found in and near ponds, lakes, reservoirs, rivers, and streams. It is active at night in warm, low-lying areas, and is diurnal at high elevations and in the north. It buries itself in loose soil or seeks shelter in burrows of gophers, ground squirrels, and other animals. It tends to walk rather than hop. This toad has a mellow high-pitched chirruping or plinking sound; a chorus may sound like a flock of geese. Reproduction is aquatic, fertilization is external, and clutches of 5200 eggs are laid in January to early July. Eggs hatch within 3-10 days.</p>
