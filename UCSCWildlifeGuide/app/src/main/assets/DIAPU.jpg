<p>This snake can be found in moist habitats, such woodlands, forests, grasslands, chaparral, farms, and gardens. It is seldom seen in the open, preferring to stay on ground under bark, beneath and inside rotting logs, and under stones and boards. Females lay one or two clutches of 2-10 eggs between June-July. It eats Slender and other salamanders, small frogs, tadpoles, lizards, small snakes, insects, slugs, and earthworms. It may be venomous to small animal prey and perhaps some snake predators.</p>
