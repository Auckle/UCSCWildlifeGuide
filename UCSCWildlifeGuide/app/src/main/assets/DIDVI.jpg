<p><strong>Virginia Opossum (<em>Didelphis virginiana)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Family: </strong>Didelphidae<br />
<strong>Genus Species: </strong><em>Didelphis virginiana</em><br />
<strong>Common Name: </strong>Virginia Opossum<br /><p>
<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>
<p>The Virginia Opossum is about the same size as an average house cat, but it has a heavier body, shorter legs, five toes on each foot, pointed nose, white face, paper-thin black ears with whitish tip, and rat-like tail. Its body length is between 15-20 inches; its tail length ranges from 9-20 inches, and its weight ranges from 9-13 pounds. Appearances can vary depending on the area in which the opossum lives. For example, Northern Opossums may have partially missing ears and tail due to freezing temperatures.

<p><strong>Habitat Associations and Natural History</strong></p>
<p>The preferred habitat for Virginia Opossums is farming areas. They can also be located in woodlands, deciduous forests, and along streams. The gestation period for Virginia Opossums is about 13 days, occurs between 1-2 times a year, and produces up to 14 per litter. Each newborn weighs 2 grams each, and the entire litter can be put on a teaspoon. After birth the newborns attach themselves to one of their mother’s 13 nipples for 2 months, and those who do not perish. Opossums make leaf nests in hollow logs, fallen trees, abandoned burrows, and other sheltered places. When threatened, it is common for the Virginia Opossum to roll over, shut its eyes, allow its tongue to loll, and feign death (aka “playing possum”).</p>
