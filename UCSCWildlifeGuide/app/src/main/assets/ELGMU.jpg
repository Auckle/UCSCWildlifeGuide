<p><strong>Habitat Associations and Natural History</strong></p>
<p>This lizard can be found in grasslands, chaparral, oak woodlands, and open pine forests. In drier areas, it is most likely near streams or in moist canyon bottoms with abundant plant cover. It occasionally enters water to escape an enemy. Around houses, it may live in old woodpiles and trash heaps. It is partly nocturnal during warmer parts of the year. This lizard eats slugs, insects, centipedes, scorpions, and spiders, including the highly venomous black widow, lizards, and small mammals. Females lay 1-3 clutches of 5-20 eggs between May-July.</p>
