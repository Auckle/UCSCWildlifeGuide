<p> The Ensatina has a body length between 1½-3⅕ inches and a total length of 3-6 inches. It is a smooth-skinned salamander with 12-13 costal grooves and “swollen” tail constricted at its base. When tapped on the back an Ensatina may stand stiff-legged and swaybacked with its tail arched. Its color varies greatly, but nearly all have yellow or orange limb bases. Males tend to have enlarged upper lips and a slimmer and longer tail than in females.

<p><strong>Habitat Associations and Natural History</strong></p>
<p>This amphibian can be found in deciduous and evergreen forests under rotting logs, bark, and rocks. Towards the south, they can be found in well-shaded canyons, oak woodlands, mixed grasslands, and chaparral. During cold or dry weather, these animals retreat to the interior of rotten logs, wood rat nests, or burrows of other animals. In the fall and spring, females lay between 3-25 eggs underground or in other cool, covered areas, which hatch within 113-177 days.</p>
