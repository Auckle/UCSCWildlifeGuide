<p><strong>Habitat Associations and Natural History</strong></p>
<p>This invasive frog is highly aquatic, usually remaining in or near permanent water. It can be found in prairies, woodlands, chaparral, forests, desert oases, and farmland. It enters marshes, ponds, lakes, reservoirs, and streams. It is easily caught when dazzled by light; when first seized it may “play possum,” hanging limp and motionless, but often times suddenly springs to life. It breeds in February-July; females can lay up to 20,000 eggs that hatch within 3-5 days. This frog will eat anything it can swallow, such as invertebrates, mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians including other bullfrogs. It has wreaked havoc on many native species.</p>
