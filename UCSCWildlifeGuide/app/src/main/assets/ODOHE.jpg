<p><strong>Habitat Associations and Natural History</strong></p>
<p>This deer can be found in coniferous forests, desert shrubs, chaparral, and grasslands with shrubs. It is most active in the mornings, evenings, and moonlight nights. It occurs singly or in small groups, and feeds mostly on shrubs and twigs, sometimes on grass and herbs. In mountain regions it migrates up in the spring and down in the fall, but on plains it does not migrate at all. Males shed their antlers in January or February. Females bear 1-3 young in June-July, and have a gestation period of about 7 months. The young are able to walk a few minutes after birth. Normal lifespan is about 16 years.</p>
