<p><strong>Habitat Associations and Natural History</strong></p>
<p>This snake lives in a variety of habitats form lowlands to high into the mountains. It is frequently found in deserts, prairies, brushland, woodland, open coniferous forests, and farmland. Soil conditions of its habitat vary—sand, loam, rock, or hardpan. It is a good climber and burrower, and is active chiefly by day except in hot weather. When aroused it hisses loudly and sometimes flattens and broadens its head and vibrates its tail. In dry leaves, the vibrating tail may sound like a rattler. It eats rodents, rabbits, moles, birds and their eggs, lizards and insects. It kills chiefly by constriction. Females lay 1-2 clutches of eggs of 2-24 eggs between June-August.</p>
