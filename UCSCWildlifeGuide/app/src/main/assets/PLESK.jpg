<p><strong>Habitat Associations and Natural History</strong></p>
<p>This skink inhabits grasslands, broken chaparral, piñon juniper and juniper-sage woodlands, and open pine-oak and pine forests. It seems to prefer rocky habitats near streams with abundant plant cover, but can also be found on dry hillsides far from water. It is active in the daytime, but usually keeps out of sight. It eats insects, spiders, and sowbugs. Females lay clutches of 2-10 eggs between June-July.</p>
