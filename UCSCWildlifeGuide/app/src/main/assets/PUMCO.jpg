<p><strong>Habitat Associations and Natural History</strong></p>
<p>This cat is found in rugged mountains, forests, and swamps. It is mainly nocturnal, but may be seen during the day. It is a very secretive animal, and is seldom seen. It is usually on ground, but climbs trees, especially to evade dogs. It feeds largely on deer, but also takes hares, rodents, and occasionally domestic animals. It stores its uneaten portions of kills, but won’t eat tainted meat. It dens in any concealed, sheltered sport, and roams widely (75-100 miles) from its place of birth except when its cubs are small. It bears 1-6 young any time of the year every 2-3 years, and has a gestation period of 88-97 days. May live up to 18 years in captivity.</p>
