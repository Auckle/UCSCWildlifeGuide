<p><strong>Habitat Associations and Natural History</strong></p>
<p>This frog inhabits humid forests, woodlands, grasslands, and streamsides. Generally found in or near water. It calls in a series of 4-7 guttural notes on one pitch; sounds like uh-uh-uh-uh- uh-rowr. Calls last 1-3 seconds, but are weak and easily missed; calls are typically given under water. It eats a wide variety of invertebrates, and uses its large, sticky tongue to catch and eat prey. Its long legs give this frog tremendous leaping ability, which it uses to resist predators. Females lay between 530-830 eggs in a large gelatinous cluster, which is attached to vegetation under water. The cluster eventually floats and eggs hatch after about four weeks.</p>
