<p><strong>Habitat Associations and Natural History</strong></p>
<p>Vagrant Shrews reside mainly in marshes, bogs, and wet meadows. They can also be found along streams in forests. The gestation period for these mammals is about 20 days and occurs more than once a year. The newborns open their eyes in about a 1week and are weaned at about 20 days. Vagrant Shrews are active day and night, and are known to eat insects, sowbugs, centipedes, spiders, earthworms, slugs, and some vegetables. It is not uncommon for these creatures to eat 1⅓ times their own weight each day. They lay nests of dry grass or leaves in stumps or logs, molt twice a year, and have a maximum lifespan of 16 months.</p>
