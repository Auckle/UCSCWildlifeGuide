<p><strong>Habitat Associations and Natural History</strong></p>
<p>This squirrel mates in early spring and bears 4-15 young once a year, and gestation period is 25-30 days. It is diurnal and colonial. It preys on birds, eggs, and insects, and also eats green vegetation, fruits, berries, seeds, mushrooms, and acorns, which are stored in dens. It burrows from 5-200 feet on gentle slopes; these burrows may have many openings and may be used for several years. Most adults estivate in July or August; hibernate in October or November, then emerge in January. Home range is normally less than 150 yards across. When threatened, a loud chirp warns others of danger.</p>
