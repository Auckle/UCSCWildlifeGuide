<p><strong>Habitat Associations and Natural History</strong></p>
<p>This mammal prefers rocky bluffs and brush-bordered canyon stream beds. The spotted skunk has a defense mechanism similar to the striped skunk that consist of spraying a foul smelling musk from two glands next to their anus. Spotted skunks mate once a year producing 2-5 kits in late April or May after a gestation period of 210 to 230 days. Spotted skunks are nocturnal and have an omnivorous diet 〔<a href="http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Spilogale_gracilis/">ADW</a>〕.</p>
