<p> The California Newt has a body length between 2¾-3½ inches and a total length of 4.9-7.8 inches. It is similar to the Rough-skinned Newt, except it usually has less contrast between the dorsal and ventral colors on the sides. It has light-colored lower eyelids, larger eyes with corneal surfaces that extend to or beyond the outline of head when viewed from above, and Y-shaped teeth in the roof of the mouth. The breeding male has smooth skin, a bulbous vent, flattened tail, and dark skin on the undersides of the feet.

<p><strong>Habitat Associations and Natural History</strong></p>
<p>This newt can be found in ponds, lakes, and slowly flowing streams. In the Sierra Nevada and southern California mountains, it enters larger rivers and streams with faster moving water. It eats small invertebrates such as worms, snails, slugs, sowbugs, and insects. Females lay one to two dozen eggs in spherical masses on aquatic plants or submerged forest litter from December to May. Adults may cannibalize their eggs.</p>
