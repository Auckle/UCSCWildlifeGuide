<p><strong>Habitat Associations and Natural History</strong></p>
<p>This snake can be found in grassland, brushland, woodland, and open forest, from sea level to high in mountains. It often occurs near streamsides, springs, and lakes. Its habits are chiefly terrestrials. When frightened it often seeks shelter in dense plant growth or other cover on land rather than seeking shelter in water. It eats slugs, snails, leeches, earthworms, fish, salamanders, frogs, toads, tadpoles, lizards, snakes, small mammals, and occasionally birds, and carrion. Females bear 4-27 young between July-September.</p>
