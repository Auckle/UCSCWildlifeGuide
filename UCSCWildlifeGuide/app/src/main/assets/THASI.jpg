<p><strong>Habitat Associations and Natural History</strong></p>
<p>This snake can be found in many environments such as grassland, woodland, scrub, chaparral, and forest. It lives in or near ponds, marshes, prairie swales, roadside ditches, streams, sloughs, damp meadows, woods, farms, and city lots. It tends to stay near water and is an excellent swimmer. It often defends itself energetically when cornered, and when caught smears its captor with excrement and odorous content of anal glands. It bears 3-85 young between May- November. It eats fish, toads, frogs, tadpoles, salamanders, birds, small mammals, reptiles, earthworms, slugs, and leeches. It is one of the few predators that can eat adult Pacific Newts without suffering lethal poisoning.</p>
