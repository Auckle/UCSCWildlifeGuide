<p><strong>Habitat Associations and Natural History</strong></p>
<p>The Red Fox is an exotic,  non-native species that has been reported at Younger Lagoon. It is  considered a threat in this area because it hunts ground nesting birds  that have not adapted to live where there are such predators. The Red  Fox is slowly replacing the native Gray Fox in many areas, due largely  to the effects of human activities. The Red Fox can be found in forests and open country. It bears 4-9 young once a year between March and April depending on latitude. Its gestation period last 51 days; the young remain in a den for about a month, come out to play and feed, then leave parents in the fall to fend for themselves. Its diet consists of any available animal within the size range of an insect and a hare, berries, and fruits. The males initially bring food to the pups and vixen for a few days after birth, then the vixen joins the male in providing food.</p>
